With exact arithmetic, the evaluation of the Harmonic Series suggests it diverges:

- math goes here

In floating point arithmetic, a finite sum is achieved because of unit roundoff, which determines the maximum possible relative error in representing a nonzero real number in a floating point system.
- a floating point number is a finite rational approximation of a real number: u / v
- a system of floating point numbers has a bound (see 6/45) of min and max
-- this means that in any floating point system, the approximation of 1/n as n grows large eventually reaches min (realmin in Matlab)
-- it also means that eventually the approximation of the series will reach max (realmax in Matlab)
--- once at max, the system is unable to represent a higher number, so an approximation of the Harmonic Series will reach max
